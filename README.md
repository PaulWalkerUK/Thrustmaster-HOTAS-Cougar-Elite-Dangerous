# Thrustmaster-HOTAS-Cougar-Elite-Dangerous
A Foxy profile for Elite Dangerous for the Thrustmast HOTAS Cougar.

There are 3 important files to make this profile work:
 * **`HOTAS-Cougar-P72endragon.binds`** - This maps controls to functions in the game. This is what you see when you go into the Controls screen under Settings.
 * **`Elite-Dangerous-P72endragon.tmm`** and **`Elite-Dangerous-P72endragon.tmj`** - These are the configuration files that Foxy uses.
 
## Instructions 
1. Put `HOTAS-Cougar-P72endragon.binds` into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings` (by default, this should resolve to something like: `C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings`)
2. Open `Elite-Dangerous-P72endragon.tmm` and `Elite-Dangerous-P72endragon.tmj` with Foxy and download the profiles to your joystick
3. In Elite Dangerous, from the main menu, go to Options then Controls then under Presets, select HOTAS-COUGAR-P72ENDRAGON
